# Interview Scheduler

This is a single page app built using React to allow users to book, edit, and cancel interviews from Monday to Friday. By doing so, the "spots remaining" will immediately update with how many, if any, are free. You will also get an error if trying to book without filling in a name or selecting an interviewer.
